Django jazzmin (Jazzy Admin)
============================
Drop-in theme for django admin, that utilises AdminLTE & Bootstrap to make yo' admin looky jazzy

This was initially a Fork of https://github.com/wuyue92tree/django-adminlte-ui that I refactored so much I thought it 
deserved its own package, big thanks to @wuyue92tree for all of his initial hard work, I am still patching into that 
project were possible, but this project is taking a slightly different direction.

Installation
============
::

    pip install django-jazzmin
